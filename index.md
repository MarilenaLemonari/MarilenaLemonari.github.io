## Short Bio
Γειά σας! I am Marilena Lemonari and currently, I am a PhD student of **Computer Science/Graphics** at the _University of Cyprus (UCY)_ under _CLIPE_, a Horizon Marie-Curie ITN project. Before that, Ι was awarded my MSc in **Machine Learning** from _UCL_ (2020). In 2019, Ι received my BSc in **Mathematics** from _The University of Nottingham_.

Recently, Ι have completed my 3-month secondment at Inria as a research guest, during which, she has worked on intuitive control for characters and small groups. 
As an Early-Stage Researcher (ESR) for CLIPE, my research interests revolve around crowd control and authoring, machine learning for computer graphics and behavioural crowd simulation.
